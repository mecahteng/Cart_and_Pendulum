Problem statement
The cart-and-pendulum system moves along an infinitely-long and frictionless horizontal track. The
pendulum’s joint is also frictionless. The cart is moved by the input force u. The equations of motion for this system
are as follows:
(m +M)¨x = −ml ¨ϕ cos ϕ + ml ˙ϕ2 sin ϕ + u (1)
l ¨ϕ = −g sin ϕ − ¨x cos ϕ (2)
where x and ϕ are the cart’s position and the pendulum’s angle respectively. The cart and pendulum masses are
M = 3 kg, and m = 1 kg, and the pendulum length is l = 1 m. Take g = 9.81 m/s2 to be downward.
The cart and pendulum are initially at rest, with the cart at x = 0 and the pendulum vertically downward, ϕ = 0.
The goal is to hit a target located at T = (1m, 0.5m) with the tip of the pendulum at precisely t = 2 s.
